                <h2> The First Martyr and Beacon of Faith</h2>
                <p><b>Saint Stephen</b>, the first Christian martyr, exemplifies unwavering faith, compassion, and dedication
                    to Christ. Chosen as a deacon for his wisdom and piety, Stephen served the early Christian community
                    by aiding the poor and preaching the Gospel with fervor. His eloquent defense of Christianity before
                    the Sanhedrin highlighted his deep understanding of Scripture and unflinching commitment to his
                    beliefs. Facing execution by stoning, Stephenâ€™s final prayers for forgiveness of his persecutors and
                    commendation of his spirit to Jesus echo Christ's own words on the cross. Celebrated on December
                    26th, Saint Stephen's legacy of courage, conviction, and forgiveness continues to inspire Christians
                    worldwide.</p>
